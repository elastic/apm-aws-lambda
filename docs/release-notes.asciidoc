[[aws-lambda-eol]]
=== End of life

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving
forward on future development and innovation.
Our https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[End of life policy] defines how long a given release is considered supported,
as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance.
The table below is a simplified description of this policy.

|====
|Version |End of maintenance term
|1.x.x  | The later of 2024-10-26 or 6 months after the release of 2.0 (TBD)
