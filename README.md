# apm-aws-lambda

[![Build Status](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/buildStatus/icon?job=library%2Fapm-aws-lambda-mbp%2Fmain)](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/job/library/job/apm-aws-lambda-mbp/job/main/)

This repository contains code and tools for working with Elastic APM's AWS Lambda solution.  

If you're looking to get started with Elastic's AWS Lambda extension and agent instrumentation, the [AWS Lambda Extension](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/monitoring-aws-lambda.html) documentation is the place to start. 

### Update the docs

Backport any changes made in the `docs` directory to the branches that you'd like to see the docs show up in. Branch names must follow the `major.minor` naming scheme and match a new or recent Elastic Stack version.
